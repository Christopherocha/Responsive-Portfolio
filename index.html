					<p class="about-paragraph">I am born and raised in Austin, Texas. I was around 20 years old when I finally decided to pursure a college degree, and then I was about 22 when I realized I had made a huge mistake doing so. I promptly decided college was not going to be for me. Shortly after that, I decided to move to Brooklyn and fell in love with the city. Some family needs required my presence back in Texas so I moved back to accomodate their needs. I worked in the service industry for a couple more years until I decided I could not stand doing it anymore.</p>
					
					<p class="about-paragraph">I started working at a software company doing Tech Support, which was okay, but I was not too fond of dealing with call center life. Just like many other things in my life, I did not know what I wanted to do with my life at that point until I realized I was already in the career I wanted to pursue. This was after a couple of promotions, thankfully getting out of support, and being introduced to the world of web development, which I immediately enjoyed the challenges this line of work presented.</p>
